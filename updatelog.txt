- Added shadcn components, form, inputs, and buttons
-> used it to create login form (zod form schema, shadcn form)
-> Added multiple types of field, string (length check + confirm Password check), date picker, select

- Added data table to display scorecard

- Styled register form with tailwind using samples from furever treasures hero section

- added nested navbar in scorecard page



TODOS:
- give form inputs a set width so they don't resize when error messages are displayed
- refactor nested navbar to work dynamically
- tournament List component having issue with typescript, similar to that encountered before in furever treasures, refer to that to solve it later

In progress:
- Add bowling line up in scorecard
- Make blocks and tweak adjust of tournamentList
- Make more teams for teamList
-> add Links, buttons and team Name (done)

Todo with interim ERD:
- should financial transactions be part of database or should it be removed altogether?
-> if needed, then erd should reflect it

- the procedure of team requests should be reflected in ERD

- need to make screens to allow admin creation of tournaments and updating match schedules etc

- update home screen to reflect what info is available to all

- then update pages so that certain parts/pages only visible to certain user roles 
-> hence, need to update erd to reflect login info and user roles
